# React-Redux Boilerplate
A generic setup for a `react-redux` project with `gulp` to compile SASS to CSS. Also includes `Bootstrap` and `jQuery` as webpack modules.

After `npm install` run `npm start` to run the server on port 7000.

Run `gulp` in another tab to track and compile the SCSS files to CSS.
