# React-Redux Boilerplate
A generic setup for a `react-redux` project using `webpack` with `gulp` to compile SASS to CSS. 

After `npm install` run `npm start` to run the server on port 7000.

Run `gulp` in another tab to track and compile the SCSS files to CSS.

## Main Features
- `babel` for compiling ES6
- `babel-preset-react-hmre` to reduce refreshing for every little change
- `eslint` for linting. What else?!
- `express` for running your node server
- `gulp` for compiling sass to css
- `jQuery`, `bootstrap-loader` and `bootstrap-sass` for use of bootstrap styles and javascript 

I hope this helps get the ball rolling on your react-redux journey!
